I am a first year Ph.D. student at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). I am intereted in Computer Systems and Network. Currently I am advised by Prof. [Sanidhya Kashyap](https://sanidhya.github.io/) on adapting multiversion synchronization primitives to heterogenous memory architecture. 
Previously I worked with Prof. [Chenren Xu](https://soar.group/chenren/) on the performance prolifing of commercial 5G systems on the High-Speed Rails (HSR). I also enjoy hacking linux systems and served as the system adminstrator. I am fond of High Performance Computing as well and led the Supercomputing team of Peking University under the guidance of Prof. [Yun Liang](https://ericlyun.github.io/) and Senior Engineer [Chun Fan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0ZZamLoAAAAJ&hl=en). I received my BSc with honours in Computer Science and Technology in 2022 from Peking University (PKU). Besides, I minored in Finance at the School of Economics, PKU.

Besides research, I enjoy doing all kinds of sports. I played soccer for several years and have supported Man. Utd for over a decade. I once got injured in this super intensive sport and took 2 arthroscopy operations for FAI (Femoroacetabular Impingement) in the year 2022 Feel free to drop me email if you want to consult any FAI related questions.  I also participate in running, swimming, cycling and other ball games (tennis, table tennis). 

Another huge interest that I have is to explore different food, culture and languages. I like to study various recipes including French, Italian, Japanese and Chinese. I have a plan to reach each and every perfecture-level city in China. I am currently learning French and Cantonese at the same time.
