# Abstract
In this paper, we conduct measurement of the operational 5G and LTE on the HSR. We reveal the key characteristics of 5G and LTE in extreme mobility in terms of throughput, RTT, loss rate, signal quality, and physical resource utilization. We further develop a taxonomy of handovers in both LTE and 5G and carry out the link-layer latency breakdown analysis.
